1. Line 9 would print "values added: 20"
2. Line 13 would print "final result: 20"
3. Line 9 would print "values added: 20"
4. Line 13 would return an error because result is only defined in the if block, and since the variable is called outside the block it cannot be accessed.
5. Line 9 would return an error because result cannot be altered, so line 7 would throw an error because it is attempting to change a constant variable
6. Line 13 would return an error because it can only be called if add is true, and since there is an error inside the if block as explained in the previous question this line will never be called.
